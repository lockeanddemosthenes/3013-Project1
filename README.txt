What we should do to test:

--------boring.c-------
just test that this compiles and outputs the appropriate statistics

-------custom.c--------
test:
      --ccd and then cpwd (in the same file)
      --file longer than 32 lines
      --file with shorter than 32 lines
      --file with exactly 32 lines
      --file with some blank lines in the middle
      --normal command with multiple arguments

-------multi.c---------
